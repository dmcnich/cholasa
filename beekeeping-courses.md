Why not combine a weekend beekeeping course with a visit to one of Scotland’s most remote and beautiful islands. Courses are taught at two levels:-

Beginners - to suit complete beginners and those with some background and who are perhaps starting with their own bees.

Intermediate – to suit those with some experience but who wish to improve skills.

## The Beekeeper
    
Andrew Abrahams has kept bees commercially on Colonsay for over 30 years and has wide experience of honey production and queen rearing. He holds the Scottish Beekeepers Association Master Beekeepers Certificate and has a BSc (Hons) Degree in Agriculture. He has teaching experience in both beekeeping and agriculture.

## The Courses

![Having fun keeping bees]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/Web%20site%20Bees%20Courses%20008.jpg)

All courses are limited to 8 participants, allowing everyone to get good access to the bees. Participants are encouraged to handle the bees and to raise their individual questions and concerns. Teaching is based very much on the premise that, we forget much of what we read or hear; we remember some of what we see; and we forget little of what we do

If the weather permits, all teaching is carried out in the apiaries, working with and learning from the bees. Much emphasis is placed on learning how to handle bees gently.
