Colonsay is the smallest island in the entire world with its own brewery.

We employ ten per cent of the island's working population -- Chris and Bob. Colonsay Brewery is based at the heart of our small community on the Atlantic Island from which we take our name.

It's not easy making beers and lagers in such a remote location but we believe the unique environment of the island and our seaside location combine to allow us to make products of an exceptional quality.

The pace of life here on Colonsay is that of a bygone age in mainland terms with the weeks punctuated with the coming and going of the lifeline ferry service provided by Calmac three times a week in winter and more often in the summer.

The team at Colonsay Brewery have set out to capture the essential elements of this wild and rugged island and bring them together with some brewing expertise to allow you to taste....
