## Flying Visits

In addition to our excellent <a href="/getting-colonsay">ferry service</a> Colonsay has a splendid air-service operated by <a href="http://www.hebrideanair.co.uk">Hebridean Air Services</a>, so there is plenty of scope for frequent and "impulse" visits to the island. It is quite possible to "mix-and-match" - perhaps fly out to Colonsay on Thursday afternoon, and return by ferry a few days later; or in fact choose almost any combination of days (just as long as you do not try to include Saturday as a day of travel). And of course we have a magnificent 500 metre tarmac runway, so private pilots are welcome (PPO).
