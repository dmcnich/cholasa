## Update March 2017

We are happy to say that, currently, all crofts are tenanted. Although there are no community crofts available at present, please feel free to send us an email or give us a call to register interest or to request further information. We can then keep you updated and contact you should a croft become available.

## Update March 2013

Having finally thought we had tenants for all 5 crofts, one has decided to leave. This means of course that an opportunity has opened up for some other enterprising person. Progress on the crofts has been slow with a number of legislative difficulties having had to be addressed but hopefully a successful applicant will benefit from what has been achieved to date.

Colonsay Community Development Company have a croft to let on the island of Colonsay. This is a bareland croft with “in principle” permission to build a house from Argyll and Bute council.The croft comprises 5.3h.a, with perhaps 2 ha arable. It is hoped to be able to offer a share of the 45h.a  common outrun in the future.

If you are interested in this opportunity contact Donald MacNeill for more information. Initial expressions of interest should be received by 19th April 2013.

## Colonsay Croft Project - Update 2.2.2012

All the crofts have now been offered, with four young families moving to the Island and one local family gaining a tenancy and the security that affords.

It has been a very difficult process happening as it did during the worst economic downturn for many years but it is hoped that the new Islanders can look forward to an exciting few years as they build their houses and settle into Island life.

The challenges facing them are significant with living expenses and freight much higher than that on the mainland; quality of live however is also much higher than that on the mainland!

I would like to thank all the families who have shown an interest in the project, it must number hundreds, and hope they have found some way to realise their dreams.

## THE PROJECT WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED AS FOLLOWS:

**The Colonsay Croft Project**

The community of Colonsay, with the aid of the Scottish Land Fund, has purchased an area of land with the intention of creating 5 bareland crofts ("bareland" = no house). The tenant of each of these crofts will rent an area of land which has outline planning permission for the construction of a dwelling house. As a crofting tenant he/she will be eligible for grant aid for help with the costs of construction and infrastructure. Information about crofting can be obtained by following the link to the [Crofter's Commission](www.crofterscommission.org.uk).

Applicants will be required to sign a "letter of comfort" agreeing not to sell the house on the open market, but as part of the croft..

DON'T BE PUT OFF, read on...

Recent legislation has broadened the definition of crofting away from traditional agriculture to include any viable business venture.

Potential projects might be eligible for grant aid for the construction of buildings, start up costs etc.

**Who do we want?**

We want resourceful, independent well-motivated people. You will be expected to submit a business plan, and a transparent allocation policy will be applied to select applicants. We would like families but rule out no one. New businesses may be eligible for assistance from Argyll and Islands Enterprise <http://www.hie.co.uk>

**What should you do?**

A comprehensive information pack is being developed and should be available by the beginning of April.

In the meantime, for further informal information contact me initially by e-mail at <colonsay.croft@btinternet.com> and I will arrange a time for you to phone me.

Good luck -
