![Ceol cholasa logo](/images/unnamed.jpg)Ceòl Cholasa is usually held the third weekend of September each year, and for 2018 the dates will be 13th to 16th September.

13th to 16th September 2018 will see Colonsay celebrating its 11th Music Festival. Over the past decade, thanks to the hard work of the Islanders and the  generosity of the artists Colonsay has consistently managed to attract Scotland’s finest musicians to the smallest (and we think best) festival in the land. It’s a tribute to Colonsay’s charm that busy musicians are willing to take a weekend out of their touring schedules to come and make music with us.

And they do: on stage, in the pub, at impromptu parties and who knows what goes on behind closed doors!

The charm of our festival is that we get the chance to mingle with the musicians and they get a chance to step back from their busy schedules and very definitely mix business and pleasure.<br />Why not join us?

For a flavour of Ceòl Cholasa have a look at this short film by Rachel Hendry.
