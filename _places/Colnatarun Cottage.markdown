Colnatarun is located on the west of the island, 4 miles either way, from the Pier, Hotel and Colonsay General Store. Delightfully situated, our cottage is spacious, well equipped and comfortable - a real home from home. A warm welcome awaits you. Jan and Archie will meet you at the pier and transport you to the cottage if you have no vehicle or meet you at the cottage on arrival. To make you instantly at home we greet you with fresh flowers, home made shortbread and a bottle of wine as well a small cupboard stocked with basic commodities e.g. tea, coffee, sugar, sauces, cooking oil and condiments.
