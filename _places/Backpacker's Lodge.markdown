The Lodge is located in a peaceful spot in the centre of the island with commanding views towards Loch Fada. It is quiet and peaceful with no other houses close by. The pub, shop and pier are 2 km away. The Lodge is very well equipped and has a large garden with lawns and shrubs and outdoor furniture.

The Lodge consists of a Victorian former gamekeeper's house and two traditional stone bothies adjacent to the house. The bothies are particularly rustic with exposed stone walls on the inside. The house is newly refurbished and is extremely comfortable.
Sleeping a maximum of 16 people in two separate buildings, for those on a budget, the Lodge is a peaceful and comfortable base from which to explore the island.
