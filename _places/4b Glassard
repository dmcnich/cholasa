Built in a traditional style, the architect-designed property has been reversed internally from the norm to provide the main living accommodation with an elevated outlook by locating these rooms on the first floor. This upper floor commands magnificent views and the opportunity to observe the changing panoramic seascape across to Jura and Islay.
