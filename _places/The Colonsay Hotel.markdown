Built in 1750 as an inn for the local population and the rare visitor, the exterior of The Colonsay hotel in Scotland has remained largely unchanged. Perched on the hillside above the harbour, the hotel has commanding views over the sea to the neighbouring island of Jura.

Inside, The Colonsay retains much of its original charm and is relaxed and comfortable. With open fires, painted floorboards and deep sofas in the bar, log room, library or restaurant, there is always a perfect spot to relax in. The restaurant is more gastro-pub than formal dining and uses local produce wherever possible.

We provide free wireless internet access throughout the downstairs rooms in the hotel.
