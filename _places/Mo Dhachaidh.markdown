Mo Dhachaidh is a traditional Island Home overlooking Kiloran Bay uninterrupted views of The Isle of Mull and over to Iona. Until the summer of 2015 it had been in the same family ownership since being built as a family Croft house in 1922, passing from one generation to the next. As Mo Dhachaidh is Gaelic for “My Home”, we have styled the house as a comfortable base for you to explore the wonderful natural surroundings and the wild beauty of Colonsay. Within Mo Dhachaidh and during 2015/16, all the rooms have been refurbished, on the ground floor a new kitchen, dining room with an open fire, comfortable lounge, the master double bedroom, a family bathroom and an entrance hall.
