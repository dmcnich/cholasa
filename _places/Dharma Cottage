Dharma Cottage is a modern cottage approximately three miles from the ferry port and is situated near the west coast of Colonsay.
The Cottage has three bright and airy double letting rooms. Two rooms have spacious power showers and the third room has a shower and traditional bath. There is a comfortable and cosy guest lounge with a large selection of books for the guests to browse through, there is also a T.V. with a selection of DVD films to watch - or maybe you would just like to relax and meet the other guests. Tea and coffiee is available at all times in the dining room where breakfast is also served. Continental and full Scottish breakfast is available (please state which, on arrival). If there is any special food requirement, please let me know when booking.

The cottage is in a convenient location for trout-fishing in Loch Fada and is centrally placed to explore the entire west coast including a half-mile walk to the dramatic sea cliffs to witness the largest sea-bird colony in the Southern Hebrides. A comfortable one-mile walk (or bike hire from Archie MacConnell, 01951 200355) would place you at Machrins Bay, the golf course and the trrack which leads you to the remote Ardskenish peninsula.
