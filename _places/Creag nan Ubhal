Creag nan Ubhal is a modern house, on the north west coast of Colonsay, about 4 miles from the ferry terminal at Scalasaig. It has wonderful panoramic views across Uragaig towards the Ross of Mull, the Torran Rocks and Dubh Artach lighthouse. It is an excellent centre for walkers, ornithologists and botanists. Buzzards and harriers are frequently seen above the raised beach in front of the house. A short walk takes you to pebble beaches, with cliffs where kittiwake, gannets and razorbills can be found. Another five minute walk takes you to the magnificent Kiloran Bay, with its unbroken golden sands. Nearby Loch an Sgoltaire and Loch Fada are ideal for trout fishing.

The house has three letting rooms, two twin-bedded en suite rooms, and one double bedded room with a private bathroom. All rooms have views across the sea towards Mull, Iona, and Tiree. Each room has tea/coffee making facilities, colour television with Freeview, hairdryer and radio alarm clock. We also have a large guest lounge with a well stocked library, board games, television and DVDs for the occasional wet day. Free WiFi internet access is available.

There is a choice of continental or full Scottish breakfast which is served in the separate dining room. Packed lunches are available on request. Dogs are very welcome downstairs, but we cannot allow them in the bedrooms.
