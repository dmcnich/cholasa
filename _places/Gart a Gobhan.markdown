Gart a' Gobhan cottage is on the west coast of the isle - a small, white rendered cottage with magnificent views of the setting sun.  It is our dream-come-true, a very much loved family home. Downstairs has a large double bedroom, king size bed and views to sea and garden, bathroom with shower-over; separate toilet with washing machine and dryer. Kitchen/dining room is newly refurbished, with handbuilt wooden painted units and butler's sink. Fridge/freezer, cooker, microwave plus large oak table and 6 wooden chairs. We have recently built a restful sitting room with large --shaped sofa and two armchairs. A multi-fuel stove makes the room cosy even on the coldest of nights.  This room has a huge glass wrap-around window giving panoramic views to the sea and sunsets. Up the steep stairs, a double bedroom with drawers and built-in wardrobe; small but very comfortable. Also a twin room with drawers and tiny wardrobe.
