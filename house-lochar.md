For well over twenty years, this small publishing business has operated from Colonsay, making full use of digital technology and building a list of excellent titles. We hope that you will enjoy reading through our catalogue - all of our titles are available through reputable bookshops worldwide, but of course we are delighted to fulfil retail orders direct from our warehouse here in Colonsay.

We are very much a local business and your support is very much appreciated. Whenever you purchase directly from our premises in Colonsay, you maximise the benefit for all concerned.

Please note that all books in our catalogue with a "Buy Now" button are available for immediate despatch, normally postage free within the UK. In a few cases, a contribution towards postage is required and clearly indicated. Your transaction is completely secure and operated by PayPal (credit and debit cards are accepted); no third party can see your card details, not even us!

For all purchases, please refer to our main catalogue <http://houseoflochar.com> which includes Airmail postage options for all destinations.

If you are in Colonsay, please visit our [Bookshop]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/shops-food/bookshop), which carries all our own titles in addition to a very wide range of other books - it has an excellent reputation and owes its success to the support of its loyal customers - thank you!
