Meetings are normally held on the last Tuesday of each month in the Servicepoint. These are open to all with an agenda advertised on the preceeding Tuesday. Minutes of each meeting can be found for download at the bottom of this page. These are made available once they have been approved at the following meeting.

CCDC manages the service point on behalf of Argyll and Bute Council under a service level agreement.  HIE have provided funding for 2018/19 towards additional costs of employing a project development officer to deliver the company's busines strategy.  Carrie Seymour and Ros Jewell have been appointed as a job share.

The CCDC is currently involved in a number of exciting projects on the island. Further information on each can be found below. It is important to note that delivery of these projects is supported by Highlands and Islands Enterprise.

## Recycling

The community of Colonsay will soon have it’s own food waste recycling facility. A Ridan composter will be located at the Argyll and Bute Council depot on the Machrins road, where raw and cooked food waste will be recycled along with garden waste, to produce garden compost. This project has been funded by the Marine Harvest Common Good Fund and Islay Energy Trust. A committee of volunteers has taken ownership of this project.  They will arrange collection caddies for those who want to take part and pick-up on a regular basis. This will go a long way to reduce the carbon foot print of Colonsay’s visitors, residents and businesses by diverting food waste fromland fill.  This will be particularly important when landfill sites for such waste will be closed in 2021.  CCDC plans to continue with recycling and other waste reduction initiatives in collaboration with Argyll and Bute.

## Play Park

Colonsay Community Play Park opened its gates on the 21st July this year after three years of consultations, planning and fundraising. The equipment and installation of the park were made possible with awards donated by The Big Lottery and The Robertson Trust. The park is now cared for by a committee of local volunteers. The park, located directly below the community garden and the village hall, has been in almost constant use since the opening, proving popular with locals and visitors alike.

## Land Purchase/Housing Development

The LDO survey of 2011 found that housing was the most important issue to address for the CCDC and this has been confirmed by community consultation in 2017. With staff funding and additional support from HIE, the directors are pursuing all possible avenues to secure sufficient land to meet the housing needs of the community.  Colonsay Estate is willing to sell land to the community for social housing and negotiations are underway; resolution of the access difficulties with the permitted scheme for 5 houses at Lower kilchattan are being pursued; and purchase of available and suitable sites on the island are being investigated.

Afforadble housing and job oppurtunities are key to halting the loss of young people and to attracting new residents. It is widely believed that you cannot have one without the other, so establishing affordable accommodation will encourage further employment on the island.  At the same time, CCDC will be seeking to develop land and buildings for employment opportunities.

## Community Website

This very website is owned and operated by the CCDC. In 2017 it was decided that a thourogh overhaul of the community site was required. In 2018, with some financial help from HIE, the new site was launched. Some areas of the site still require attention but the work is ongoing. Further improvements are planned to help keep the site up to date and as user friendly as possible.
