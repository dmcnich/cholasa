title: MacPhie Bagging
---

A "MacPhie" is defined as an eminence in excess of 300ft in height, and is Colonsay's equivalent to a Munro, only smaller. The aim is to climb all the peaks on Colonsay and Oransay that exceed 300ft (91.46m), in the course of one connected walk. The journey has to start and finish with any point below High Water mark, and the "MacPhies" can be tackled in any order. There are 22 peaks in the Official List, and the distance is about 20 miles.

Although there is no competitive element in terms of speed, details of your favoured route and time may be of interest to other people. For example, Eric Brown took 6hrs 44mins on 11 July 1996 (Route:4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,3,2,1).

More recently, on May 2 2002, Jethro Lennox managed the remarkable time of 3 hours 56 minutes and 44 seconds, having started at the Strand and finishing at Kiloran Bay.

Each MacPhie is listed below but a handy pdf with a map of each one is available for download.
