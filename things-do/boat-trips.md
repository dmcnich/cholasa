## BYOB - Bring Your Own Boat

Many visitors bring a boat of their own. Certain holiday homes lend themselves to the purpose and it is possible to launch dinghies at The Strand, at Machrins and at Port Mor - but do remember that these are Atlantic waters and not to be under-estimated.

The harbour facilities are very limited and are subject to a fee, payable at the Pier Office (about £10.00 per four days or £31.50 per month to use the harbour). It is possible to launch quite easily at the main slipway, and to launch or recover using the more sheltered one within the harbour (£4.00 to cover both launch and recovery).

Facilities for visiting yachts are largely restricted to the close-boarding along the northwest section of the main pier - for which there is a charge (about £10.00 per four days up to 10m, about £15.00 over 10m). The slipway and harbour are entirely tidal and not normally a convenient option. For further information, please contact the <a href="mailto:byrne@colonsay.org.uk">harbour-master</a>.
