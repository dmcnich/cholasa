## Publications about Colonsay

The island bookshop at Scalasaig carries a large selection of books, specialising in titles with a Scottish and Hebridean flavour. We also have an antiquarian section for rarer sources. It is more than just a bookshop, also selling craft items, woolen items, cards and small gifts. The Bookshop is open in summer, Monday - Saturday 3 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. It can be accessed at other times by contacting Kevin and Christa Byrne at Homefield tel. 01951 200320.  Contact Georgina, at home on 01951 200375, to discuss any special or unusual books.

It is also home to a well-respected publishing company, House of Lochar. The list of over eighty titles includes many classic works, most of which have a special resonance in the West of Scotland.  For online purchases of Colonsay titles or for details of the entire catalogue, please visit the House of Lochar website.
