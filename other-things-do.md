There's no lack of activities to fill your holiday on Colonsay. We've highlighted a few on their own pages in the menu above, and some other ideas below:

## Cave Exploration

The caves at the north end of Kiloran Bay are visited quite easily, but the New Cave to the south requires a bit of planning. Make sure you have at least two torches, and that somebody knows where you have gone. The approach is quite difficult - wear long trousers and tread warily. There are quite a few other caves at Uragaig and elsewhere, but remember that they are all in use. The otters, bats, pigeons, spiders and other inhabitants are very tolerant, but please minimise the impact of your visit.

## Heritage Centre

Visit the temporary heritage centre at Port Mòr. Find out more about the [Colonsay and Oransay Heritage Trust]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/our-community/colonsay-and-oransay-heritage-trust).

## Star Gazing

With our low levels of light polution, there are many opportunities to enjoy the sky at night. Many holiday homes are well positioned in this respect, otherwise the most accessible viewing points are around Kiloran Bay or the golf-course at Machrins. Look northwards to avoid the reflected lights of Glasgow and Lochgilphead; the Northern Lights are a rare but truly awesome spectacle and shooting stars can be seen most nights.

## Antiquities and Social History

Almost any walk or expedition is enhanced by an objective. On your rambles you will find all sorts of sites of interest, everything from hut-circles to bait-holes. Many of these sites have never been recorded, but all the monuments in Colonsay and Oransay are listed and described in the RCAHM booklet available at the Bookshop (£9.95); there is also a [website](https://canmore.org.uk/search/site?SIMPLE_KEYWORD=colonsay) which will prove worthwhile but it may be enough to select sites from the Ordnance Survey map.

## Make a Film

You could make a fim, and post it on Youtube! There are half-a-dozen examples already on line to inspire you - click the youtube link at the foot of the page to find them.

Here is an example, by Sandra Cairney, who visited in May 2018

Another remains a bit of a favourite - it is a film by Laura Brown, showing the controlled explosion of a WWII mine in Kiloran Bay - the soundtrack is great, because the Bomb Disposal team allowed the primary schoolchildren to press the button!

## Miscellaneous

Some things can almost go without saying, but do remember the delights of kite-flying, picnics, barbecues, cowrie-shell collecting, treasure-hunts, bicycling, kayaking, skinny-dipping, rock-pools, comparing lichens, following half-forgotten pathways, and admiring lizards, dragonflies and water-boatmen. If you happen to be a serious metal-detector person, and have permission to search, please have a word with Kevin Byrne as he has an idea for a worthwhile ploy...
