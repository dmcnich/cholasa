Located just 200 yards from the pier, with amazing views looking out over the pier and onto the Jura Hills, where you can sit back and relax &amp; enjoy our wide selection of coffees and teas along with one of our amazing home baked cakes!

The Pantry offers a full range of meals, including a traditional breakfast, also snacks and treats of every description.  Try our home-baked cakes, tiffin or fly-cemetery with a variety of teas and coffees.  We hold special themed evenings from time to time, we have a special weekly night dedicated to fresh fish from local waters, and we cater for weddings and special events, on our premises or elsewhere, including BBQs.

We have a licence and our stocks include locally produced and award-winning Colonsay beers and gin.  We also stock the famous Colonsay Honey, and a range of gifts and mementoes, including postcards, prints and reproductions of vintage Colonsay photographs.
