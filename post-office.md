Colonsay Post Office is situated in Scalasaig attached to Colonsay General Store and is in easy walking distance from the pier, [Pantry]({{ site.baseurl }}/shops-food/pantry"), [Brewery]({{ site.baseurl }}/shops-food/colonsay-brewery), [Bookshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/shops-food/bookshop), Christine's Den, The Old Waiting Room Gallery and the Hotel.

The Office includes a delivery office and post is delivered to all parts of the island except Balnahard and Ardskenish. Regreattably the Post Bus service has been withdrawn.

The Office is open from 9:00 to 13:00 Monday - Saturday and 14:00 - 17:30 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday throughout the year except Christmas, New Year and various public holidays. There is a pillar box outside the office available 24/7. The deadline for mail acceptance varies somewhat in line with the ferry service. As a rule of thumb, try to ensure that outgoing mail is posted a couple of hours before the departure of a ferry going to Oban. Note that some ferries do not carry the mail, and delay may arise should the boat service be disrupted.

The Office accepts Royal Mail and Parcel Force Items for all parts of the world and prices can be obtained on application or by Royal Mail website. Next day delivery is restricted due to the boat service, please enquire at the counter or on 01951 200323. Other services are available including the purchase of National Savings Premium Bonds, postal orders, stamps, mobile phone top ups and euro notes.

Cash can be obtained by using a Debit Card of most major UK banks. Foreign currency can be pre-ordered for a wide range of countries and Moneygrams can be sent. Leaflets for many Post Office services are available.

On the retail side we have a range of greeting cards, picture post-cards with local and other views and various stationery materials including pens, pencils also artist and writing pads. We can arrange flowers by post. We stock various items made by Pauline Campbell. The retail items can only be paid for with cash.

The staff are Keith Rutherford (Postmaster) and part-time clerks Barbara Clark and Jane Rose. All will be pleased to asist you on all postal matters. Tide table information is also available, ask at the counter.
