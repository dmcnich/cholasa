Just over 8 years ago, The Colonsay Tourism &amp; Marketing Group came up with the idea of having a festival to celebrate the wonderful season of spring on Colonsay, and set about organising an event to bring visitors to the island to enjoy this season and to learn more about the rich natural heritage. Thus the annual Colonsay Festival of Spring was born.

2019 year will be the 9th year that the three week event has taken place, and the high calibre of expert tutors and event leaders continues to be a strong draw to visitor and islanders alike. The basic format has remained the same across the 8 years - every day of the 3 weeks having a mixture of nature &amp; craft activities, as well as guided walks and evening talks.

Each year the individual events are varied, with old favourites being run alongside new activities.

29th April - 19th May 2019

the programme will be available shortly. For a taste of previous festivals go to [the springfest website](http://www.colonsayspringfest.co.uk).
