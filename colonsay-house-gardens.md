Colonsay House Gardens are considered to have one of the finest rhododendron collections in Scotland.  The private inner gardens and Cafe are open to the public on Wednesdays and Fridays.

The Colonsay House rhododendron and woodland garden is considered to be one of the finest rhododendron gardens in Scotland. It was planted mostly in the 1930's and has an exceptional variety, not only of rhododendrons, but also of trees and shrubs including some exotic species from the southern hemisphere.

The woodland garden covers some 20 acres.
